# Project Unicorn
### Repository Overview
This project examines the low profitability of a fictitious company’s Central Region. By analyzing profit ratios across regions, states, and product categories, it identifies underperforming areas and recommends strategies to enhance profitability. Developed as a practical exercise in data analysis, the project utilizes PostgresSQL, spreadsheets, and Tableau.
In this repository, you will find:
* PDF documentation associated with the project
* The Colab notebook containing data queries
* The spreadsheet used for analysis
* Links to the files in Google sheets, Colab notebook and Tableau
  
#### Motivation and Context

This project was conceived as a practical exercise to explore data analysis tools within the context of a fictitious company. Its primary goal was to conduct a rapid and straightforward dataset analysis to identify potential business improvements, even without extensive knowledge of the company’s operations. By focusing on profitability issues in a specific region, the project uncovers actionable insights and proposes targeted recommendations to address the root causes of low profitability in the Central Region. Serving as an introductory framework, this project provides a replicable approach for businesses or analysts to identify and resolve profitability challenges effectively.

#### Technologies Used

* _PostgresSQL_: Chosen for querying and analyzing large datasets due to its efficiency and flexibility in handling relational data.

* _Spreadsheets_: Used for detailed calculations, pivot tables, and visualization of specific metrics at a granular level.

* _Tableau_: Selected for creating interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and share insights in an accessible format.

### Methodology
The process follows a hierarchical approach to pinpoint the root causes of profitability issues. By drilling down from region to state, then to category and product level, it ensures that recommendations are specific and actionable.

* _Data Exploration_

* _State-Level Analysis_

* _Category and Product Analysis_

* _Strategy Development_


#### Challenges and Limitations

* _Time Constraints_: Limited to one week of analysis, restricting deeper dives into some aspects of the data.

* _Fictitious Data_: Context and assumptions are based solely on the dataset without real-world validation.

* _Complexity of Discount Analysis_: Challenges in isolating the exact impact of discounting practices due to overlapping factors.
